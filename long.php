        <p>The release of the Papers and the newspapers’ win of the Supreme Court case reaffirmed the freedom of the press in the long term. This was the first time in history that a government had censored a newspaper in the name of national security (“Pentagon Papers”). And in this unprecedented case, the Supreme Court ruled that government restraint of the right to publish was a violation of the first amendment and the right to the freedom of the press (United States, “An Enlightened People”, Chokshi). It was a landmark case and set a precedent for future cases involving the freedom of the press (Chokshi). Katharine Graham, the publisher of the Washington Post, said "we are extremely gratified not only from the point of view of newspapers, which was not the least of our concerns, but gratified from the point of view of government, and the public's right to know, which is what we were concerned with" (MacKenzie). In the long term, the release of the Pentagon Papers and the court case is one of the most famous examples of the right of the freedom of the press (“Vietnam: The Public's Need to Know...”).</p>
        <p><em>“The historic decision of the Supreme Court in the case of the United States Government vs. The New York Times and The Washington Post is a ringing victory for freedom under law. By lifting the restraining order that had prevented this and other newspapers from publishing the hitherto secret Pentagon Papers, the nation's highest tribunal strongly reaffirmed the guarantee of the people's right to know, implicit in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.” “It would be well for the present Administration [Nixon Administration], in the light of yesterday's decision, to reconsider with far more care and understanding than it has in the past, the fundamental importance of individual freedoms—including especially freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly—to the life of the American democracy. ‘Without an informed and free press,’ as Justice Stewart said, ‘there cannot be an enlightened people’”</em> (“An Enlightened People”).</p>
