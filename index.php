        <p>On June 14, 1971, the U.S. government prevented newspapers from publishing certain documents in the name of national security for the first time in history (Apple 5). These documents were part of a classified study done by the U.S. government about their involvement in the Vietnam War, and are better known as the “Pentagon Papers.” The Papers revealed how the U.S. government and the White House had lied to the public about the U.S.’s involvement in the War (“Pentagon Papers”). For example, the Papers showed that President Lyndon B. Johnson had ordered a bombing in North Vietnam in effort to pressure the Vietnamese to stop supporting the Việt Cộng (Vietnamese political organization), despite the U.S. intelligence community saying that the bombing would not do so ("Pentagon Papers"). Whistleblower Ellsberg obtained the Papers and gave them to Neil Sheehan of the New York Times in March 1971. Sheehan provided Ellsberg with a place to stay where he would be safe, and spent three months reading and analyzing the over 7,000 pages of the Papers. The New York Times began publishing the Papers in June 1971, three months after being given the Papers by Ellsberg (“Pentagon Papers”, Chokshi, Sheehan 1-35). On June 15, 1971, one day after beginning publishing the Pentagon Papers, Attorney General John N. Mitchell filed an injunction against the New York Times, saying “further publication of information of this character will cause irreparable injury to the defense interests of the United States” (Chokshi). This was the first time in history that the government had restrained the press in the name of national security (Apple 5). The Washington Post also began publishing the Papers several days later, but was given the same injunction (“Pentagon Papers”). However, the newspapers took the government to court, and historically won a landmark Supreme Court case on June 30, 1971, allowing them to continue publishing the Papers (Apple 5, MacKenzie, United States). <strong>Although the release of the Pentagon Papers caused tension between the press and the government and resulted in a short term threat to national security, it ultimately served to reaffirm the freedom of the press in the long term.</strong></p>
