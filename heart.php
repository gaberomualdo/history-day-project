        <p>The release of the classified documents that are the Pentagon Papers and the subsequent Supreme Court case that the newspapers won caused a tension between the press and the government. First, the government has an inherent incentive to keep classified documents from the public (“Pentagon Papers”). In the case of the Papers, the press released classified documents against the will of the government (Chokshi, Apple 5), causing tension. The government fought back with a court injunction (“Pentagon Papers”, Chokshi), but the press continued to publish, even at the risk of becoming convicted criminals (Apple 5, MacKenzie, United States). The press continued the conflict by beginning a court case against the government, asking for the right to publish, which they won (United States). This win from the newspapers set a precedent for reporters to constantly question the government, and for the government to take steps to prevent future leaks (Apple 5). The Nixon administration created the White House “Plumbers Unit” to prevent future leaks and whistleblowers (Apple 5). In the case of the Papers, Nixon attempted to wiretap Ellsberg, and even bribe his therapist, looking for incriminating information (“Pentagon Papers”). The Nixon administration and the government continued this conflict with the press with further surveillance and illegal wiretapping, which eventually came to light in the Watergate Scandal several years later (“Pentagon Papers”). The Watergate Scandal was brought to light by the reporter’s continuous investigation into the government which pivotally began with the release of the Papers (“Pentagon Papers”). Since the release of the Pentagon Papers, several government scandals have been brought to light by the press, including the Edward Snowden NSA leak, numerous WikiLeaks leaks, the Panama Papers, and the Afghanistan Papers among others. In many of these cases the government sought to punish or censor the newspapers and whistleblowers publishing the information. Edward Snowden sought asylum in Russia to escape the U.S. government, Chelsea Manning (WikiLeaks whistleblower) was sentenced to 7 years in prison, and Julian Assange (creator of WikiLeaks) is currently incarcerated in the United Kingdom. This continuous conflict in which the press releases classified documents in the name of freedom of the press and the government fights back in the name of national security began with the release of the Pentagon Papers in 1971.</p>
        <p><em>"A more-or-less permanent tension between reporters and officeholders has developed -- not an altogether unhealthy state of affairs, perhaps, so long as it does not degenerate into deep-seated animosity and distrust. For reporters, the official version of events is "spin," not fact. Government officials tend to believe that reporters judge and interpret before they bother to report."</em> (Apple 5).</p>
