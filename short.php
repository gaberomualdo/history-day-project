        <p>In the short term, the release of the Papers caused a very minor threat to national security of the United States. In the Supreme Court hearing, the United States government argued that the release of the Pentagon Papers would damage the national security of the nation (United States). The court case ended 6–3, with three justices believing that the Papers would indeed do harm to national security. Justice Blackmun said that he thought that there may have been some actual soldiers who were harmed due to the release of the papers (MacKenzie). Justice Stewart and Justice White said the continuing release of the Papers would harm the public interests of the U.S., and possibly harm national security (MacKenzie). While there could have been some harm done to U.S. soldiers due to the release of the Papers, it’s clear that the harm, if any, was very minor (MacKenzie). Most of the key people involved in the story of the Papers believe that the release did not compromise national security at all (Apple 5). Neil Sheehan and his team as well as reporters from the Washington Post were reportedly adamant in redacting any information which could have harmed any individual soldiers. This makes it clear that the threat to national security caused by the release of the Papers was very minor, and they primarily served to inform the public of the true scope of the government’s involvement in the War and their lies to the people.</p>
        <p><em>“[Justice] Blackmun said he feared there was ‘some foundation’ to claims that the disclosures would cause actual death of American troops and pose obstacles to negotiation with the enemy, possibly to the point of prolonging the war”</em> (MacKenzie).</p>
